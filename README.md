# dwd
A simple application to fetch and process weather warning from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)

This application uses the public web service offered by the DWD, it is
in no way affiliated with them, and they should not be contacted for
questions or complaints.

Also, the data provided by the DWD is for Germany only, obviously.

Since I have only a very vague knowledge of markdown and am a
long-time emacs user, I keep my notes [in an org-mode file](dwd.org).
